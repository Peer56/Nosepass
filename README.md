This repository is very stupid! Do not use this if you're serious about making a GBA pokemon project!!!!
[Use pokeemerald instead](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald)

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository onto your device.
2. Get a clean ROM of Pokemon Emerald (U), name it "Emerald.gba" and put it in the extracted folder.
3. Run `MAKE_HACK_full` to generate EpicHackrom.gba, an edited copy of Emerald.gba with your changes added.
4. `MAKE_HACK_full` should be run whenever changes are intended to be made to the ROM.
